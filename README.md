I made a dependancy for the link module. This is a small module provides a standard custom content field for a link.
This way, within a peice of content, such as event or career/job opening, the user can put the webform to the content type.
If all the careers use the same webform, then just link to the webform and title_pop will automatically tie in the node information, such as Title to the webform, such as Position Interested In.

Here's an example:

Content Type Career:
Job Title
School requirements
Location of Position

Apply Webform Fields:
Name
Phone 
Email
School Degree
Position Applying For


Using the title_pop module one can tie the Job Title in the content type
with the Position Applying For in the webform, so that when someone
clicks over the to the webform the field will be filled out.
